## Challenge 2 (8 points)

Doing analysis on a data set is very difficult when you don't nessesaily know what the fields mean. For example, Flag Touch After Event
seems like it is probably a relevant field, but I am not entirely sure what it corralates with. The analysis I decided upon was viewing
the times where Gravity Z was highest, corrlated with when the error occures. As I don't have a description for the fields, I am not really
sure if this is correct. But it seems that often later in the study the z acceleration of the phones for most users went up. I wouldn't
be entirely suprised if this correlated with an error (setting the phone down, pulling it away from you in frusturation); but I don't 
have a ton of evidence to back that up.
